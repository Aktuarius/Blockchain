# HSBC Coin

This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept applciation of the etherdata blockchain in the clearing and settlement of equity securities.   This implementation utilizes the ERC20 tokenization to create a token corresponding to the ownership of HSBC shares on a hypothetical stock exchange. This may then be deployed to the etherdata blockchain using the deply.ts script.
